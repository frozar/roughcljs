# RoughCLJS - example

This example of using `RoughCLJS` produce the following:
![roughcljs-example](https://github.com/frozar/roughcljs/blob/master/example/example.svg "RoughCLJS example")


`RoughCLJS` is a wrapper around the nice drawing library `RoughJS`:
https://roughjs.com/

The purpose is to provide a simple clojurescript interface to get shape
generated by `RoughJS` without messing around JS object, data structure,
method, field, integration, etc.

`RoughCLJS` wrap only the svg part of the `RoughJS` library.

This project has been generated by:

```shell
npx create-cljs-project roughcljs
```

## Compilation

To compile the project:
```shell
shadow-cljs compile app
```

### Optional development tools

It's also possible to run nREPL since the server is already started:
```shell
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
```

Or, as usual during development, use cider inside emacs:
```
M-x "cider-jack-in-clj&cljs"
```

## Usage

Once the server is launched, the application is available at
`http://localhost:8080/`.
