# RoughCLJS - example

This example of using `RoughCLJS` produces the following in the browser:
![roughcljs-example](https://github.com/frozar/roughcljs/blob/master/example/example.svg "RoughCLJS example")

This project has been generated by:

```shell
npx create-cljs-project example
```

## Compilation

To use `RoughCLJS` you have to install the npm packages dependancies:
```shell
npm i create-react-class react react-dom roughjs
```

To compile the project:
```shell
shadow-cljs compile app
```

### Optional development tools

It's also possible to run nREPL since the server is already started:
```shell
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
```

Or, as usual during development, use cider inside emacs:
```
M-x "cider-jack-in-clj&cljs"
```

## Usage

Once the server is launched, the application is available at
`http://localhost:8080/`.
